About Me
=====
I am a second year Master's student at the [Department of Computational Linguistics of University of Z\:{u}rich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html). I am currently working on my thesis project on linking songbirds speech and neuronal activity at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html).

I love Indo-European Linguistics and Musical Composition. For indo-european, I traveled around Europe to take Ancient Language classes around. I was offered a residency scholarship to stay at Roman villa to study humanities and philosophy in Latin at 2018.

and then settled down at Paris to study musical composition at the CRR de Paris and Saint-Maur.


Musical Training
-----
2019-2022: Conservatoires de Paris, DEM Musical Composition, Organ<br>
2020-2021: CRR de Saint Maur, Musical Composition<br>
2020-2021: CRR de Boulogne-Billancourt, Musical Composition<br>

I am very lucky to have followed the greatest tonal composers in France: Stephane Delplace, Françoise Levechin-Gangloff, Thibault Perrine, Fabien Touchard, and François Saint-Yves. I also benefitted from harp courses of an extraordinary teacher Marta Power, and a world-class harpist Nicolas Tulliez. During my stay in Paris, I had the honor to attend the Master classes of Isabelle Perrin and Isabelle Moretti. In addition to this, I am privileged with day-long access to one of the best Organs in France when I was a fellow student of Jean-François Hatton.
