Intro
=====
I am a second year Master's student at the [Department of Computational Linguistics of University of Z\:{u}rich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html). I am currently working on my thesis project on linking songbirds speech and neuronal activity at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html).

I love Indo-European Linguistics and Musical Composition. I traveled around Europe to take Ancient Language classes around and then settled down at Paris to study musical composition at the CRR de Paris and Saint-Maur.

and then I did pure math and musical composition. I started with keyboards at 6 and fell in love with it. Later I picked up Organ and Harp at Paris.

I am very lucky to have followed the greatest tonal composers in France.
