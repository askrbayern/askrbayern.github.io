About Me
=====
I am a second year Master's student at the [Department of Computational Linguistics of University of Z\:{u}rich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html). I am currently working on my thesis project on linking songbirds speech and neuronal activity at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html).

I love Indo-European Linguistics and Musical Composition. I traveled around Europe to take Ancient Language classes around and then settled down at Paris to study musical composition at the CRR de Paris and Saint-Maur.

and then I did pure math and musical composition. I started with keyboards at 6 and fell in love with it. Later I picked up Organ and Harp at Paris.


Musical Training
-----
2019-2022: Conservatoires de Paris, DEM Musical Composition, Organ<br>
2020-2021: CRR de Saint Maur, Musical Composition<br>
2020-2021: CRR de Boulogne-Billancourt, Musical Composition<br>
2017-2022: Harp, private courses<br>


I am very lucky to have followed the greatest tonal composers in France: Stephane Delplace, Françoise Levechin-Gangloff, Thibault Perrine, Fabien Touchard, and François Saint-Yves. I also benefitted from harp courses of an extraordinary teacher Marta Power, and a world-class harpist Nicolas Tulliez. During my stay in Paris, I had the honor to attend the Master classes of Isabelle Perrin and Isabelle Moretti. In addition to this, I am privileged with day-long access to one of the best Organs in France when I was a fellow student of Jean-François Hatton.
